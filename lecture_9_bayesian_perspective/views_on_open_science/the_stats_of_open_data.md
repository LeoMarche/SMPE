# The state of Open data

## Interesting

The rapid evolution of Open Science ecosystem and DMP tools makes it complicated to adapt.

Researchers globally fell that open data isn't rewarded enough and would do more of it if ti would come with more benefits (citations, ...).

## Unexpected

A lot of respondant don't know what a data management plan is. This isn't really correlated to the date of the first pulication of researchers (which is unexpected because we would expect "recent" researchers to be more aware).

The DMP awareness depends a lot on the country (cultural differences).
