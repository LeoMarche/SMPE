## Challenger article

Given the article, a few points show lack of methodology and rigor in the work:
- There is no data for low temperature and the curve of density of failures against temperature tends to show that the relation is not linear.
- Datas where there is no malfunction has been excluded, however, they are mandatory as they ARE INFORMATION. If not taken in account, any probability estimated with the datas is strongly biased.
- There is no incertitudes calculated for the regressions, even if the regression obviously looks false (even visually, it is strongly uncoherent with the density curve).
